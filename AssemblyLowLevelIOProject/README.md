The low-level program requests user to input 10 signed integers by recording string representation of inputs. Converts string integers into signed integers and stores within an array. The conversion from string to integer shifts according to ASCII table value and represents the value as hexidecimal at a low level. Tests input is valid by ensuring input is within the required range (neg)2^31 to 2^31 sub 1 and does not contain any improper characters that do not convert to an integer. Finally, the program reverses functionality and converts back to string before printing to console. Sum and truncated average are displayed also using a procedure to print strings.
