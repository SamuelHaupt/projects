My portfolio of projects provide a glimpse into my programming abilities and achievements. Each program includes a README for a quick overview. Please read before viewing the code. (Emily McMullan contributed to group project in Payroll Management App. Clement107 was my previous username before switching.)

All programs have been built within a three year time period.
