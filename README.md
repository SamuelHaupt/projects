My portfolio of projects provide a glimpse into my programming abilities and achievements. Each program includes a README for a quick overview. Please read before viewing the code. (Emily McMullan contributed to group project in Payroll Management App.)

A new project will be added after March 25th, 2023 when the term completes. The project is called small shell and mimics bash. It is written in C and provides forking, execing, redirection, and foreground/background processes. 

All programs have been built within a three year time period.
