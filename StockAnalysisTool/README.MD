The Stock Analysis Tool is a quantitative tool used for evaluating stock investing systems based on percentage losses, investing patterns, and duration of holding stocks. There are many other factors to be included in the tool that have yet to be added. At the present, simplicity is my goal with designing the tool. This program offers insight into my oop design processes using Python programming language. (Version history will include Clement107 as contributor. I am owner of this account; I am transitioning to my namespace GitHub account.)






Program is used for research purposes only and is not a recommendation on how to invest. If you use the program, I will not be held liable for any losses suffered.
