Genetic Algorithm is a technique to find an optimized solution to a problem set that contains many false peaks. It uses operators known as reproduction, crossover, and mutation. The material in this project comes from David Goldberg's *Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning* (1989). He carried foward popularized work from John Holland's *Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems* (1975).

The purpose of the project is to learn how to deploy a simply genetic search algorithm as described in the first few chapters of Goldberg's book. I may not take the project beyond this simple introduction of reproducting a genetic algorithm. There is the posibility to expand this project to learn about non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA).
